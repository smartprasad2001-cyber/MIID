  "query_template": "Generate 6 variations of {name}, ensuring phonetic similarity where some sound-alike names are Light (10%), Medium (50%), or Far (40), and orthographic similarity where some visually similar names are Light (20%), Medium (60%), or Far (20%). Approximately 40% of the total 6 variations should follow these rule-based transformations: replace spaces with random special characters, delete a random letter, and add a title suffix.\n\n[VALIDATION HINTS]:\nPhonetic similarity: 10% Light, 40% Far, 50% Medium.\nOrthographic similarity: 20% Far, 20% Light, 60% Medium.\n\nThe following address is the seed country/city to generate address variations for: {address}. Generate unique real addresses within the specified country/city for each variation.\nThe following date of birth is the seed DOB to generate variations for: {dob}.\n\n[ADDITIONAL CONTEXT]:\n- Address variations should be realistic addresses within the specified country/city\n- DOB variations ATLEAST one in each category (±1 day, ±3 days, ±30 days, ±90 days, ±365 days, year+month only)\n- For year+month, generate the exact DOB without day\n- Each variation must have a different, realistic address and DOB\n\n[UAV REQUIREMENTS - Phase 3]:\nReturn variations in the NEW structure. For the seed \"John Smith\" ONLY, use this structure:\n{\n  \"John Smith\": {\n    \"variations\": [[\"name_var\", \"dob_var\", \"addr_var\"], ...],\n    \"uav\": {\n      \"address\": \"address_variant\",\n      \"label\": \"explanation\",\n      \"latitude\": float,\n      \"longitude\": float\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nFor all OTHER seeds, use the standard structure (variations only):\n{\n  \"other_seed_name\": [[\"name_var\", \"dob_var\", \"addr_var\"], ...]\n}",
