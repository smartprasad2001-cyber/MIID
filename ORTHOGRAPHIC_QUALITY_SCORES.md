2. Leonid Pasechnik
3. Anna Molchanova
4. Yelena MIZULINA
5. Varee KRATUMPORN
6. Alexey Chubarov
7. Ilya Medvedovskiy

### High Quality Scores (0.75 - 0.99)
2 names achieved high quality scores:
- Ivan Nareiko: 0.7800
- Maria Butina: 0.8533

### Moderate Quality Scores (0.40 - 0.74)
1 name achieved moderate quality:
- Anastasiya Eshstrut: 0.4867

### Lower Quality Scores (0.30 - 0.39)
5 names achieved lower quality scores (0.3400):

## Distribution Analysis

**All 15 names achieved perfect distribution matching:**
- **Light (0.70-1.00)**: 20.0% (target: 20%)
- **Medium (0.50-0.69)**: 60.0% (target: 60%)
- **Far (0.20-0.49)**: 20.0% (target: 20%)

This indicates that the generator successfully matched the target orthographic distribution for all names, regardless of the quality score.

## Average Orthographic Similarity Scores

The average orthographic similarity score (how similar variations are to the original) ranges from **0.6703 to 0.7012**, with an overall average of **0.6860**.

### Highest Average Scores:
- Anastasiya Eshstrut: 0.7012
- Yelena MIZULINA: 0.6947
- Alexey Chubarov: 0.6947
- Ilya Medvedovskiy: 0.6904
- Yu Hsiang PAO: 0.6892

### Lowest Average Scores:
- Ivan Nareiko: 0.6703
- Asma Al-Akhras: 0.6752
- Maria Butina: 0.6760

## Quality Score Interpretation

The **Orthographic Quality Score** measures how well the generated variations match the target distribution:
- **1.0000**: Perfect match to target distribution
- **0.75-0.99**: Very good match
- **0.50-0.74**: Good match
- **0.30-0.49**: Moderate match
- **< 0.30**: Poor match

## Notes

1. **Distribution Consistency**: All names achieved perfect distribution matching (20/60/20), indicating the generator's distribution algorithm is working correctly.

2. **Quality Score Variance**: While distribution is perfect, quality scores vary. This is because the quality score also considers:
   - How well variations fit within each category's score range
   - The balance of scores within each category
   - The overall spread and diversity of scores

3. **Name Length Impact**: Longer names (e.g., "Umar Ahmad Umar Ahmad Hajj", "Anastasiya Eshstrut") tend to have more variation in quality scores, possibly due to the complexity of generating balanced variations across all categories.

4. **Short Names**: Very short names (e.g., "Yu Hsiang PAO") may have limited variation possibilities, which can affect quality scores.
