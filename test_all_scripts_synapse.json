Approximately 35% of the total 8 variations should follow these rule-based transformations: replace spaces with special characters, swap adjacent consonants, delete a random letter, add a title suffix, and reorder name parts.\n[VALIDATION HINTS]: Phonetic similarity: 10% Light, 50% Medium, 40% Far.; Orthographic similarity: 60% Light, 30% Medium, 10% Far. The following address is the seed country/city to generate address variations for: {address}. Generate unique real addresses within the specified country/city for each variation.  The following date of birth is the seed DOB to generate variations for: {dob}.\n\n[ADDITIONAL CONTEXT]:\n- Address variations should be realistic addresses within the specified country/city\n- DOB variations ATLEAST one in each category (±1 day, ±3 days, ±30 days, ±90 days, ±365 days, year+month only)\n- For year+month, generate the exact DOB without day\n- Each variation must have a different, realistic address and DOB",
