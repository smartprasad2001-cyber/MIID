Gemini-based Variation Generator for Maximum Scoring

This module uses Google Gemini to generate optimal name variations that maximize
validator scoring by:
1. Parsing validator query template to extract all requirements
2. Creating comprehensive prompts that guide Gemini to generate high-scoring variations
3. Ensuring proper phonetic and orthographic similarity distributions
4. Generating real addresses and perfect birthdates
5. Following all specified rules

    # Build address instructions
    address_instructions = f"""
REAL ADDRESS GENERATION (CRITICAL - VALIDATOR CHECKS WITH STRICT VALIDATION):
The validator validates addresses using THREE strict checks (ALL must pass or score = 0):

1. FORMAT VALIDATION (looks_like_address):
   - Address must be 30-300 characters (after removing punctuation)
   - Must have at least 20 letters
   - Must have at least 1 digit in a comma-separated section
   - Must have at least 2 commas (format: "Street, City, Country")
   - NO special chars: `, :, %, $, @, *, ^, [, ], {{, }}, _, «, »
   - Must have at least 5 unique characters
   - Must contain letters (not just numbers)

2. REGION VALIDATION (validate_address_region):
   - CRITICAL: Validator compares extracted country against ENTIRE seed address string
   - For seed "{address}": The validator checks if your country matches the seed
   - IMPORTANT: If seed contains a country (e.g., "New York, USA"), extract JUST the country part
   - Use the country name from seed as your address country: "USA", "United States", "Iran", etc.
   - The validator logic: gen_country == seed_address_lower OR gen_country == COUNTRY_MAPPING(seed_address_lower)
   - Since seed "{address}" contains country, ensure your addresses use that EXACT country
   - Format: "Street, City, State/Province, Country" where Country matches seed's country
   - Examples:
     * Seed "New York, USA" → Use "USA" or "United States" as country (both work)
     * Seed "Tehran, Iran" → Use "Iran" as country
     * Seed "London, UK" → Use "United Kingdom" or "UK" as country
   - Country matching is CRITICAL - if country doesn't match, score = 0

3. GEOCODING VALIDATION (check_with_nominatim):
   - Address MUST be geocodable on OpenStreetMap (Nominatim API)
   - Validator randomly selects up to 3 addresses for API validation
   - API checks: place_rank >= 20, name must be in address, numbers must match
   - Score based on bounding box area (smaller = better):
     * < 100 m² = 1.0 (FULL SCORE)
     * < 1,000 m² = 0.9
     * < 10,000 m² = 0.8
     * < 100,000 m² = 0.7
     * ≥ 100,000 m² = 0.3
   - Use SPECIFIC street addresses (not landmarks or buildings) for best scores
   - Include street numbers for precise geocoding
   - If not geocodable or fails filters, score = 0.3

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR MAXIMUM SCORE:
- Generate REAL, ACTUAL addresses that EXIST and can be GEOCODED
- Addresses MUST be from the SAME CITY and COUNTRY as: {address}
- Format MUST be: "Street Number Street Name, City, State/Province PostalCode, Country"
- Address MUST be at least 30 characters long (after removing punctuation)
- Use REAL street names that actually exist in that city
- Use REAL postal codes for that specific area
- Make addresses LONGER (add more detail) to meet 30+ character requirement
- DO NOT use generic, fictional, or made-up addresses - they WILL FAIL all 3 checks
- For Arabic/Middle Eastern countries: Use full street names, district names, and proper formatting
  * Example: "15 El-Galaa Street, Downtown Cairo, Cairo 11511, Egypt" (not just "15 Street, Cairo")
  * Include neighborhood/district names to ensure length requirement
  * Use proper transliteration of Arabic street names

Examples for "New York, USA":
✅ BEST: "456 Broadway, SoHo, New York, NY 10013, United States" (specific street, scores 1.0)
✅ GOOD: "225 Liberty Street, Financial District, New York, NY 10281, United States" (scores 0.7-0.9)
✅ GOOD: "75 Wall Street, Lower Manhattan, New York, NY 10005, USA" (specific street address)
❌ BAD: "225 Liberty St, New York, NY 10281, USA" (too short - fails format check)
❌ BAD: "123 Fake St, New York, NY 10001, USA" (fictional - fails geocoding = 0.3)
❌ BAD: "Times Square, New York, NY 10036, USA" (landmark - may have place_rank < 20)
❌ BAD: "456 Elm St, Los Angeles, CA 90001, USA" (wrong city - fails region check)

IMPORTANT FOR MAXIMUM API SCORE:
- Use SPECIFIC street addresses with street numbers (e.g., "456 Broadway" not just "Broadway")
- Include neighborhood/district for length requirement (30+ chars)
- Avoid landmarks/buildings that might have low place_rank
- Use real, well-known streets that geocode precisely (small bounding boxes)

PERFECT BIRTHDATE GENERATION (CRITICAL - VALIDATOR REQUIRES ALL CATEGORIES):
The validator scores DOB variations based on category coverage. You MUST include AT LEAST ONE date in EACH category:

Original DOB: {dob}

REQUIRED CATEGORIES (ALL must be present for maximum score):
1. ±1 day: Date within 1 day of original (e.g., {dob} → 1990-05-14 or 1990-05-16)
2. ±3 days: Date within 3 days of original (e.g., {dob} → 1990-05-12 to 1990-05-18)
3. ±30 days: Date within 30 days of original (e.g., {dob} → 1990-04-15 to 1990-06-15)
4. ±90 days: Date within 90 days of original (e.g., {dob} → 1990-02-15 to 1990-08-15)
5. ±365 days: Date within 365 days of original (e.g., {dob} → 1989-05-15 to 1991-05-15)
6. Year+Month only: Format YYYY-MM (e.g., {dob} → 1990-05) - NO DAY, just year and month

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Format: YYYY-MM-DD for full dates, YYYY-MM for year+month only
- ALL dates must be VALID (no Feb 30, etc.)
- You MUST include at least ONE date in EACH of the 6 categories above
- Score = (categories_found / 6) - if you miss any category, score decreases
- For maximum score (1.0), you need ALL 6 categories

Example distribution for 15 variations:
- 1 date: ±1 day (e.g., 1990-05-14)
- 1 date: ±3 days (e.g., 1990-05-12)
- 1 date: ±30 days (e.g., 1990-06-10)
- 1 date: ±90 days (e.g., 1990-08-01)
- 1 date: ±365 days (e.g., 1989-07-20)
- 1 date: Year+Month only (e.g., 1990-05)
- Remaining 9 dates: Can be any valid date within ±365 days

IMPORTANT: Missing any category reduces your score. Include ALL 6 categories!

NAME VARIATION GENERATION (CRITICAL FOR MAXIMUM SCORE):
- Original name: {name}
- Generate EXACTLY {variation_count} unique variations
- CRITICAL: Each variation must be UNIQUE (validator checks uniqueness - 10% weight)
  * Validator checks: combined_similarity = (phonetic * 0.7) + (orthographic * 0.3)
  * No two variations should have combined_similarity > 0.99
  * Ensure variations are sufficiently different from each other
  * If variations are too similar, uniqueness score decreases (loses 10% weight)

  * Original '{name}' length: {len(name)} characters
  * Acceptable range: {int(len(name) * 0.6)}-{int(len(name) * 1.4)} characters
  * Keep variations within this range for maximum score
- CRITICAL: Maintain name structure - multi-part names MUST stay multi-part
- For '{name}': Split into first name and last name
- Generate variations for BOTH first and last names, then COMBINE them
- NEVER return single-word variations for multi-part names (causes penalties!)
- Example: For "John Smith" → return "Jon Smyth" NOT just "Jon"

- Generate an address that looks valid but might fail geocoding
- Examples: "123 Main Str" (typo), "456 Oak Av" (abbreviation), "789 1st St" (missing direction)
- Include latitude and longitude coordinates
- Add a label explaining why it could be valid

Return in this format:
{{
  "variations": [...],
  "uav": {{
    "address": "address_variant",
    "label": "explanation",
    "latitude": float,
    "longitude": float
  }}
}}

    # Combine all instructions
    prompt = f"""You are an expert at generating identity variations for security testing. Your task is to generate variations that will achieve MAXIMUM SCORING (1.0) from the validator.

================================================================================
ORIGINAL IDENTITY:
================================================================================
- Name: {name}
- Date of Birth: {dob}
- Address: {address}

================================================================================
SCORING SYSTEM (CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY):
================================================================================
The validator scores based on these weights:
1. SIMILARITY (60% weight): Phonetic + Orthographic similarity distributions
   - This is the BIGGEST component - get this right!
   - Must match EXACT distribution percentages
2. COUNT (15% weight): Must have EXACTLY {variation_count} variations
   - Within 20-40% tolerance = 1.0, outside = exponential penalty
3. UNIQUENESS (10% weight): All variations must be unique
   - Combined similarity between variations must be < 0.99
   - If variations are too similar, score decreases
4. LENGTH (15% weight): Variations must be 60-140% of original length
   - Original '{name}' length: {len(name)} characters
   - Acceptable: {int(len(name) * 0.6)}-{int(len(name) * 1.4)} characters
5. RULE COMPLIANCE (20% weight): {rule_count} variations must follow rules
   - Missing rules = 0% for this component (loses 20% weight!)

FINAL SCORE FORMULA:
final_score = (similarity * 0.60) + (count * 0.15) + (uniqueness * 0.10) + (length * 0.15) + (rules * 0.20)

TO GET MAXIMUM SCORE (1.0):
- ✅ Match similarity distributions EXACTLY (60% weight - most important!)
- ✅ Generate EXACTLY {variation_count} variations (15% weight)
- ✅ Ensure ALL variations are unique (10% weight)
- ✅ Keep length in 60-140% range (15% weight)
- ✅ Apply rules to EXACTLY {rule_count} variations (20% weight)

{phonetic_instructions}

{ortho_instructions}

{rule_instructions}

{address_instructions}

{dob_instructions}

{output_format}

{uav_instructions}

================================================================================
CRITICAL REMINDERS:
================================================================================
1. NAME STRUCTURE: For '{name}' (multi-part), ALL variations must be multi-part
   - ✅ CORRECT: "Jon Smyth", "John Smythe", "Johnny Smith"
   - ❌ WRONG: "Jon", "John", "Johnny" (missing last name = penalty!)

2. SIMILARITY DISTRIBUTION: The validator MEASURES similarity using algorithms
   - Phonetic: Uses Soundex/Metaphone/NYSIIS (measures sound similarity)
   - Orthographic: Uses Levenshtein distance (measures spelling similarity)
   - You must generate variations that will MEASURE into the correct ranges
   - Test your variations mentally: will they fall into Light/Medium/Far ranges?

3. UNIQUENESS: Each variation must be >1% different from all others
   - Validator checks: (phonetic * 0.7) + (orthographic * 0.3) < 0.99
   - Ensure variations are sufficiently different

4. RULES: You MUST apply rules to EXACTLY {rule_count} variations
   - Missing rules = 0% for rule compliance (loses 20% weight!)
   - Apply rules clearly and visibly

5. COUNT: EXACTLY {variation_count} variations - no more, no less
   - Validator checks count strictly (15% weight)

================================================================================
FINAL CHECKLIST BEFORE RETURNING:
================================================================================
✓ Do you have EXACTLY {variation_count} variations?
✓ Are ALL variations multi-part (if original is multi-part)?
✓ Do your variations match the phonetic similarity distribution EXACTLY?
✓ Do your variations match the orthographic similarity distribution EXACTLY?
✓ Did you apply rules to EXACTLY {rule_count} variations?
✓ Are ALL variations unique (combined similarity < 0.99)?
✓ Are all variations 60-140% of original length?
✓ Are addresses REAL and from the same region?
✓ Are birthdates covering ALL 6 required categories?
✓ Is your output valid JSON with no extra text?

Generate the variations now. Remember: Similarity distribution matching is 60% of your score - get it right!"""
